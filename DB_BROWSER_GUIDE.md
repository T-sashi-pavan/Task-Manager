# 🎯 **SOLUTION: DB Browser Compatible Files**

## ✅ **FIXED: Now Exports Actual .db Files!**

Your database integration now exports **TWO types** of files that DB Browser for SQLite can use:

### 📊 **Option 1: .db File (RECOMMENDED)**
- **File Extension**: `.db` 
- **What it is**: Actual SQLite database file
- **How to use**: 
  1. Open DB Browser for SQLite
  2. File → **Open Database**
  3. Select your `productivity-tracker.db` file
  4. **Done!** Browse your data immediately

### 📝 **Option 2: .sql Script File**
- **File Extension**: `.sql`
- **What it is**: SQL commands to recreate the database
- **How to use**:
  1. Open DB Browser for SQLite
  2. File → **New Database** (create empty database first)
  3. File → Import → **Database from SQL file**
  4. Select your `.sql` file
  5. Data gets imported into the new database

## 🚀 **How to Test Right Now**

1. **Start your app** (should already be running on http://localhost:5174/)

2. **Create some test data**:
   - Register a new account
   - Add a few tasks
   - Track some time
   - Navigate between different views

3. **Export your database**:
   - Go to the **"Database"** tab in the sidebar
   - You'll see TWO export buttons:
     - **"Export as .db File"** ← Use this one for DB Browser!
     - **"Export as .sql Script"** ← Alternative method

4. **Open in DB Browser**:
   - Download the `.db` file
   - Open DB Browser for SQLite
   - File → Open Database
   - Select your downloaded `.db` file
   - **Browse your tables**: users, tasks, time_sessions, user_settings

---

## 📁 **What You'll See in DB Browser**

### Tables Created:
- **`users`** - User accounts and authentication
- **`tasks`** - All your tasks with categories, priorities, status
- **`time_sessions`** - Detailed time tracking logs
- **`user_settings`** - Dark mode, current view preferences

### Sample Queries You Can Run:
```sql
-- See all your tasks
SELECT * FROM tasks;

-- Time spent by category
SELECT category, SUM(time_spent) as total_minutes 
FROM tasks 
GROUP BY category;

-- Daily productivity
SELECT DATE(start_time) as date, COUNT(*) as sessions, SUM(duration) as minutes
FROM time_sessions 
GROUP BY DATE(start_time);
```
